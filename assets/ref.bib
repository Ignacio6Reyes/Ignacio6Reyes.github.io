%    abstract = {These twenty-two lectures, with exercises, comprise the extent of what was meant to be a full-year graduate-level course on the strong interactions and QCD, given at Caltech in 1987-88. The course was cut short by the illness that led to Feynman's death. Several of the lectures were finalized in collaboration with Feynman for an anticipated monograph based on the course. The others, while retaining Feynman's idiosyncrasies, are revised similarly to those he was able to check. His distinctive approach and manner of presentation are manifest throughout. Near the end he suggests a novel, nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory in D dimensions. Supplementary material is provided in appendices and ancillary files, including verbatim transcriptions of three lectures and the corresponding audiotaped recordings.},

  title={Application limit of the photocentre displacement to fundamental stellar parameters of fast rotators – illustration on the edge-on fast rotator Regulus },

  abstract={Differential Interferometry allows to obtain the differential visibility and phase, in addition to the spectrum. The differential phase contains important information about the structure and motion of stellar photosphere such as stellar spots and non-radial pulsations, and particularly the rotation. Thus, this interferometric observable strongly helps to constrain the stellar fundamental parameters of fast rotators. The spectroastrometry mainly uses the photocentre displacements, which is a first approximation of the differential phase, and is applicable only for unresolved or marginally objects. We study here the sensitivity of relevant stellar parameters to the simulated photocentres using the scirocco code: a semi-analytical algorithm dedicated to fast rotators, applied to two theoretical modelling stars based on Achernar and Regulus, in order to classify the importance of these parameters and their impact on the modelling. We compare our simulations with published VLTI/AMBER data. This work sets the limits of application of photocentre displacements to fast rotators, and under which conditions we can use the photocentres and/or the differential phase, through a pre-established physical criterion. To validate our theoretical study, we apply our method of analysis on observed data of the edge-on fast rotator Regulus. For unresolved targets, with a visibility V ∼ 1, the photocentre can constrain the main stellar fundamental parameters of fast rotators, whereas from marginally resolved objects (0.8 ≤ V < 1), mainly the rotation axis position angle can be directly deduced from the vectorial photocentre displacement, which is very important for young cluster studies.},
